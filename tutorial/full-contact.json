Keep in mind that NO operating system comes preinstalled. Depending on your use, I recommend FreeNAS or Ubuntu Server as they are free and incredibly efficient as server operating systems.\n\nCash only. All sales are final; no returns, exchanges, or guarantees. Questions are welcome. The server can be inspected in a public meeting as determined via email by both parties.
