Hardly used. Spent its life in a box thanks to numerous laptops. \n\nDesigned for such high-end applications as gaming, multimedia, and graphic design, the SDMHS95P from Sony is a 19-inch active matrix TFT LCD monitor with the power and flexibility to fit just about any computing need. With support for both analog and digital inputs, the SDMHS95P is compatible with a wide range of video cards, while its slim design neatly fits with today's sensibilities and ergonomic needs.\n\nWith a 1,280 x 1,024 resolution and a 0.294 mm dot pitch, onscreen images are crisp and true-to-life, while a 550:1 contrast ratio and 400 cd/m2 of brightness deliver easy-to-see images and text even in brightly lit environments. Sony's XBRITE technology optimizes brightness, color, and clarity, while its ErgoBright technology optimizes brightness levels, helping to reduce eyestrain.\n\nWith its fast 12 ms response time, the SDMHS95P consistently delivers smooth motion video and graphics, and 160-degree horizontal and vertical viewing angles provide a wide range of visual clarity, making it easy to watch movies with family, or play video games with friends. Plug-and-play compatibility makes setup quick and simple, and the onscreen display menu allows you to easily adjust the monitor's many settings.\n\nThe built-in power supply consumes about 36 watts during normal operation and just 1 watt while in standby mode. With a 17.4-by-8.5-inch footprint, the SDMHS95P fits neatly on your desktop and is VESA wall-mount compatible, allowing you to free up your desktop completely. Compatible with both PC and Mac operating systems, the monitor also comes backed with a three-year limited warranty on parts, labor, and backlight.    "},

It's been a great router - especially after installing DD-WRT on it.\n\nIf you're not familiar with that software, it essentially gives you options available only in $600+ routers. The first thing I do when I get a router is install this right away and set it up. There are apps for the Apple iPhone and Android (Droid) that allow you control this remotely - it's amazing to be able to wake up my PC remotely and log into it securely, then turn off port forwarding when I'm done to keep things safe. For what it's worth, I have the app on my wife's iPhone 6 so she can access the webcam in my daughters room when we have babysitters. \n\nGreat router, great app, can't recommend it enough. I may be willing to trade - if you can plug it in or if it's a computer part, feel free to ask. Cash is king, though, and gets first dibs. I can definitely flash it back to the default firmware if you'd like that, as well - I don't know why, but it's not for me to judge. \n\nLet me know if you have questions - I'm just a tech enthusiast who upgrades frequently and am going through an electronics update - these devices are well maintained and taken care of, and are of high quality. I also have an Asus RP-N53 - N600 Dual-Band Wifi for sale, and can bundle these together if you're looking to upgrade your network to help support new net enabled devices you may have received this holiday season!

I had cut some dense foam pads to take up the extra space (which I will include) but he almost never used them. The bag worked well as is. Inside the bag are two large padded sleeves that you can use to slide in a keyboard, trackpad, mouse, power cord or whatever. \n\nOver the course of 3 years he used it a dozen plus times and never damaged the iMac in spite of his being a teen who's not exactly delicate with stuff. The only reason we're selling it is that he's got a different computer now. I'm keeping the iMac and have no need to haul it around.\n\nIt's in very good condition. The only damage I could see is a pencil eraser sized snag on one corner which is in one of the pictures.\n\n$35 cash and local purchases only.\n\n Though often described as a travel bag, it's not intended to protect your iMac in a luggage compartment of an airplane or anything like that.

The fi-6130z scans at 30 pages per minute (single sided) or 60 pages per minute (double-sided). If you want a REALLY fast scanner, this is a fantastic scanner that is compatible with Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10.\n\nIf you want to come and see the scanner in action, just ask. It does both black and white, grayscale or in color. You will NOT be disappointed. This scanner will even vibrate the paper to eliminate the risk of scanning two pages at once. This scanner is a real workhorse that never breaks down.\n\nIf you are trying to decide which scanner is best, the SNAPSCAN scanners are for light duty. The FI series are the profession series for commercial use. This scanner for sale is an FI series scanner.\n\nThis FI-6130Z is just like the FI-6130, but it supports some great new features, such as automatically rotating a document if you scan it upside-down.  It will also automatically delete blank pages if you scan double-sided and the back side of the paper is blank.  The Z model will also clean up an image when scanning so it is more readable.   If you can afford the extra cost, the FI-6130Z is the way to go.  It uses USB 2.0, just like the FI-6130.\n\nThis scanner cost about $1,200+ new.   The $299 price is my rock bottom price and I absolutely will not negotiate a lower price.   I hate negotiating and would rather just list at my rock bottom price.    "},

I got a great MacBook for someone who doesn't care about how pretty it is!

It never let me down.\n\nGreat laptop for someone who wants a good Mac, but doesn't wanna spend much. I found similar models without cosmetic issues selling for much higher on CL.\n\nOh, the other slight problem is that the trackpad doesn't \"click\". I'm not sure if it's easily fixable or not, but for the past year I've just been using a wireless mouse, which I actually find much easier to use anyway. The mouse comes with the sale, of course.\n\nI can meet anywhere in public that's convenient. Coffeeshops are good. Thank you!    "},

(i bought this laptop seller refurbished, i dont mind but just putting that out there)\nthe edges (not the corners) of the laptop very sharp so not very uncomfortable to rest your forearm on while typing. \nOverall:\nSatisfied with this purchase. Would buy brand new if i had the resources.\n\nGreat Laptop!\n\nThis laptop has everything I need in a laptop at a great price. It's fast, has huge memory storage and works with all my device's as well as my latest external drive which would not work with my older computer running on Vista.\n\nCALL MICHAEL \n \n    "},

Boasting an Intel Core i7 processor and a spacious 1TB hard drive, the Radius P55W-B5224$1,089.00 at Amazon offers some of the best performance we've seen in any convertible system, and earns our Editors' Choice for midrange convertible-hybrid laptops.\n\n    "},

I built it up myself in 2013 with a bunch of high-end kit. It's been stable and high-performing for its few year of service.  It's currently running a fresh install OS X El Capitan V 10.11.2  using the clover bootloader. It's stable and smoking fast. This box is plug and play ready to go and comes with a bunch of accessories that are too numerous to name.  The whole package together cost about $1200 to build yourself but to buy a mac off that shelf with this level of performance would cost 3x that amount. \n\n It's also worth noting that if you'd like to build your own Hackintosh you'll not only pay significantly more than I'm asking, but you'll have to put in some serious hours setting it up, configuring the bios, installing the OS etc.  It takes some time and know-how and it's easy to mess up. \n\nSomething else that must be stated is that this is a Hackintosh, meaning it has 0 support from apple and I would not recommend buying it unless you know how to fix it yourself or are willing to take the time to figure it out. The computer comes with no guarantees and is being sold in as-is condition.\n\n  I'm looking to get a cool $600 for the whole deal.  The price is fair so don't bother.

Up to three replacements, zero-dollar deductible.\n\nIt's in excellent condition, only used for a total of maybe 40 hours, and that includes the multiple times I RDP'd into it. If you bought it today, from Amazon, it would cost:\n\n$1268 - Laptop\n$263   - 3-year accidental damage warranty\n$110   - 16GB stick of Crucial DDR4, 2400\n\nSo, you're looking at $1641, NOT including any tax. I'm looking to give you about $141 off that price as it's been used, then you're also saving another $110 by skipping out on the tax.\n\nPlease feel 100% free to request to meet up and take a look at it. I understand it's kind of a big purchase, so don't worry at all about meeting up, looking at it, and deciding against it. I want you to be comfortable with it before you buy it.\n\nI can also snap some more pictures as well, if you're interested. Don't hesitate to ask!

This is a great computer for someone who just wants to use the internet, Microsoft word, and other stuff like that. Great for a high school or college student.\n*CASH IN HAND ONLY*\n    "},

My version is just for one PC that last forever and not just one year. Paid way over $80 for this but now that I got Office, I'm just trying to salvage what I can to get something back. Please contact me if you're interested. Thanks for looking.    "},

Old work machine that's recently out of warranty but in excellent shape, doesn't appear to have left the dock very often. The original SATA hard drive has been removed and a new mSATA SSD is running everything - the SATA drive bay is open for additional storage.\n\nHaving said that, this is a used computer and everything is working great, as described above, but there is no warranty or support expressed or implied - sold as-is. This is a business-class machine that is in great shape and with the new SSD it should run for years to come. If the ad is up the system is still available.\n\nCash and local only; no paypal, checks, shipping, barter, trades, etc. Happy to meet at a public coffee shop where you can connect to the wireless and take a look at this nice machine for yourself.

(2nd one down from the top) it is functional though. it just takes a little more effort to clip in.    i built a new pc  a few months so i just have no use for 2 gaming pcs.  i do have the original boxes for the gpu, motherboard and power supply if you want them. \nNO DVD DRIVE INCLUDED.\n\n the cpu has been delidded and premium thermal paste has been used (coollaboratory liquid pro) to keep temps down. so it will run significantly cooler than a stock 4670k.  the cpu has been overclocked the whole time i owned it at 4.2 ghz. but the voltages have not been changed.  \n\nfeel free to text me with any questions. i will be happy to demonstrate functionality for anyone who requests it. \n\n\n    "},

Comes with a copy of Microsoft Office 2007 installed:) I bought a brand new high quality battery 8 months ago, so that should be good for quite some time.

Below are the specs:\n\n12.5 inch FHD display with touch and active stylus support (dell pen not included).

This is a fixed keyboard that provides a great typing experience. Much better than the surface pro keyboard and it actually works in your lap. It also has a glass trackpad. Dell also sells a folio keyboard that you can usually get on Ebay for $30 and is more like the surface keyboard and has the kickstand. I prefer this keyboard over that one (I tried both). \n\nAll in all this is a great computer for a great price. This retails for around $900 ~ $1000 from dell and still has factory warranty. I would keep this but I have a work issued computer that I must use for work and I can't justify having 2 computers. Serious buyers only, no funny business. Face to face transactions only and will meet at a local coffee shop so you can check it out on wifi. Thanks for looking!    "},
