Other than that the upper left corner is slightly cracked (see photo) but it doesn't affect the screen or functionality at all. It's never had any problems, hardware and software-wise. Comes with a copy of Microsoft Office 2007 installed:) I bought a brand new high quality battery 8 months ago, so that should be good for quite some time. Great laptop in pretty red color, running Windows 10, all set up with a new user account for you! Selling for $180 FIRM! THIS IS A GREAT DEAL!!!

You won't find a more solid, clean, configured laptop on CL. Ready to go - turn key. Power it up and start working, Win10, 10GB and it runs really fast. Office is the local install, not the 365 subscription-based version that expires and needs to be renewed. Office includes Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher and Access. Full Adobe Acrobat Standard is installed, use this to create and edit PDF files. These apps are updated and will continue to take updates and not expire.\n\nEverything is patched with the latest updates. It looks and feels brand new, the keys are still matted and don't show any wear. It's an old work laptop that never left the docking station so it was replaced with a desktop.\n\nThis is a business-class machine with a solid case, solid keyboard, bright high resolution screen and it is not like the cheap laptops at Best Buy that might be brand new but are plastic-y, come with all sorts of crapware installed and feel like they'll fall apart with any use. This is clean, as-new, solid, completely configured and ready to go.\n\nCash and local only, no barter, trade or shipping. Still available if the ad is up. Thanks for looking.    "},

I still have the original receipt. \n\nI work in IT and this has been one of my favorite computers, only I'm converting to Windows and this laptop is no longer compatible with my other devices. Looking to sell this one and replace it with a Windows device.    "},

The speed of this unit is super fast. The original Hard drive was exchanged for a brand new Samsung 850 EVO 1TB SSD Internal SATA III Solid State Drive MZ-75E1T0B 2.5\", paid $319.99  ,   The TruBrite LED lighted keyboard works remarkable fantastic in dark atmospheres, especially during lights out. Hardly any scratches on the model . Works perfect, no, none history of crashes. Now you're probably asking yourself, Why am I Selling? Very simple , I bought another same model number, exact same unit with original Hard drive , and you can bet any price that I will be replacing with a Samsung 2TB EVO 850 SSD SATA III 2.5\" 6Gb/s 3D internal MZ-75E2T0B or better , they sell for $600. ALONE ! Yes - you read right , For those who never experienced the Solid State Drive will be very grateful to navigate with this genuine product , trust me ,   Will be set to factory settings for the new user once sold - and comes with   charger ,   --- Any question, please do not hesitate !

(i bought this laptop seller refurbished, i dont mind but just putting that out there)\nthe edges (not the corners) of the laptop very sharp so not very uncomfortable to rest your forearm on while typing. \nOverall:\nSatisfied with this purchase. Would buy brand new if i had the resources.\n\nGreat Laptop!\n\nThis laptop has everything I need in a laptop at a great price. It's fast, has huge memory storage and works with all my device's as well as my latest external drive which would not work with my older computer running on Vista.\n\nCALL MICHAEL \n \n    "},

I built it up myself in 2013 with a bunch of high-end kit. It's been stable and high-performing for its few year of service.  It's currently running a fresh install OS X El Capitan V 10.11.2  using the clover bootloader. It's stable and smoking fast. This box is plug and play ready to go and comes with a bunch of accessories that are too numerous to name.  The whole package together cost about $1200 to build yourself but to buy a mac off that shelf with this level of performance would cost 3x that amount. \n\n It's also worth noting that if you'd like to build your own Hackintosh you'll not only pay significantly more than I'm asking, but you'll have to put in some serious hours setting it up, configuring the bios, installing the OS etc.  It takes some time and know-how and it's easy to mess up. \n\nSomething else that must be stated is that this is a Hackintosh, meaning it has 0 support from apple and I would not recommend buying it unless you know how to fix it yourself or are willing to take the time to figure it out. The computer comes with no guarantees and is being sold in as-is condition.\n\n  I'm looking to get a cool $600 for the whole deal.  The price is fair so don't bother.

Up to three replacements, zero-dollar deductible.\n\nIt's in excellent condition, only used for a total of maybe 40 hours, and that includes the multiple times I RDP'd into it.

I'm looking to give you about $141 off that price as it's been used, then you're also saving another $110 by skipping out on the tax.\n\nPlease feel 100% free to request to meet up and take a look at it. I understand it's kind of a big purchase, so don't worry at all about meeting up, looking at it, and deciding against it. I want you to be comfortable with it before you buy it.\n\nI can also snap some more pictures as well, if you're interested. Don't hesitate to ask!

No viruses/spyware/malware/trojans lurking beneath. CLEAN, FRESH install of Windows - no legacy garbage to slow things down, it is new and CLEAN. 64 bit Windows 10, solid state drive and 8GB of memory make this a nice, fast unit.\n\nInstalled programs: Office 2016, Adobe Acrobat Standard. The install of Office 2016 is local, it is not the cloud-based 365 version, and it includes Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher and Access. Full Adobe Acrobat Standard is installed, use this to create and edit PDF files. These apps are updated and will continue to take updates and not expire. Windows 7 Pro COA sticker on back. All programs are patched with the latest security updates. Windows Defender Anti-virus/anti-malware is installed, updated and working.\n\nSolid machine with no dead pixels or lines in the screen, no cracks in the case or frame, no missing keys on the backlit keyboard. Old work machine that's recently out of warranty but in excellent shape, doesn't appear to have left the dock very often. The original SATA hard drive has been removed and a new mSATA SSD is running everything - the SATA drive bay is open for additional storage.\n\nHaving said that, this is a used computer and everything is working great, as described above, but there is no warranty or support expressed or implied - sold as-is. This is a business-class machine that is in great shape and with the new SSD it should run for years to come. If the ad is up the system is still available.\n\nCash and local only; no paypal, checks, shipping, barter, trades, etc. Happy to meet at a public coffee shop where you can connect to the wireless and take a look at this nice machine for yourself.

(2nd one down from the top) it is functional though. it just takes a little more effort to clip in.    i built a new pc  a few months so i just have no use for 2 gaming pcs.  i do have the original boxes for the gpu, motherboard and power supply if you want them. \nNO DVD DRIVE INCLUDED.\n\n the cpu has been delidded and premium thermal paste has been used (coollaboratory liquid pro) to keep temps down. so it will run significantly cooler than a stock 4670k.  the cpu has been overclocked the whole time i owned it at 4.2 ghz. but the voltages have not been changed.  \n\nfeel free to text me with any questions. i will be happy to demonstrate functionality for anyone who requests it. \n\n\n    "},

This still has roughly 1 year of warranty on it through dell and will be transferred to the new owner. This is a great tablet/laptop and is perfect for a student. Below are the specs:\n\n12.5 inch FHD display with touch and active stylus support (dell pen not included). Thin side bezels like XPS 13.\n6th generation core M3 processor (On par with a core i5 u series but lower power, the new macbook uses this processor)\n4gb of ram\n256 gb PCIE SSD (the fastest type of ssd)\nMicro SD card slot and 2 usb-c thunderbolt 3 ports\nCharger is usb-c so it can charge your phone too (if usb-c)\nWindows 10 - Creators update\n2 cameras (selfie/skype camera and rear)\nFront facing speakers\nFanless and very quiet\n\nAlso includes Dell keyboad with backlighting. This is a fixed keyboard that provides a great typing experience. Much better than the surface pro keyboard and it actually works in your lap. It also has a glass trackpad. Dell also sells a folio keyboard that you can usually get on Ebay for $30 and is more like the surface keyboard and has the kickstand. I prefer this keyboard over that one (I tried both). \n\nAll in all this is a great computer for a great price. This retails for around $900 ~ $1000 from dell and still has factory warranty. I would keep this but I have a work issued computer that I must use for work and I can't justify having 2 computers. Serious buyers only, no funny business. Face to face transactions only and will meet at a local coffee shop so you can check it out on wifi. Thanks for looking!    "},
